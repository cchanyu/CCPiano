### Project: Piano MIDI to Keyboard Autoplay
### Original creator: https://github.com/Stereo101/python-MidiToVirtualPianoMacro

### Description: 
``` 
The script is written by Stereo101, but I modified it in the way user's will input their file name.
and also pull from any unique file, not constrainted to "song.txt".

How to use without an .exe: 
Open the command prompt and cd into the folder that the script is in.
type "python [name of the python file].py" to execute the script

the instruction is displayed on the command prompt:
Press DELETE to play/pause
Press HOME to rewind
Press END to advance
Press Ctrl+C or close window to exit

If you get an error saying missing modules:
"pip install [library name]" to install that library
```
